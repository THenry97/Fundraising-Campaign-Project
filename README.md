# Predictive_Modeling_for_DirectSocialCommunications
The project involved working with data from a real client - Direct Social Communications, a Belgium based fundraising organisation. We built a predictive classification model to select the top prospects with highest probability of donating in a future campaign. We were provided with data of past several years, the campaigns that were run and donations from recorded donors. We trained a part of our data with many algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine and Neural Networks to see the performance of each model. We narrowed our feature selection and estimated the campaign success and cost savings based on the selection by our best performing model. 
The final presentation PDF contains all insights derived during the project. 
The coding is done in Python in Jupyter Notebook.
